# World Bond/Stock(WBS) Portfolio

Constructing the WBS portfolio from 4 Vanguard ETFs: VTI(US Equity), VXUS(International Equity), BND(US Bond), and BNDX(International Bond). These ETFs are weighted according to their market cap. To find market cap data, I scrape index reports from the providers of the indices that the ETFs track(or other very similar indices). I get price data from Tiingo.

Motivation behind this portfolio comes from my FIN 494: Portfolio Engineering class and William Sharpe.
